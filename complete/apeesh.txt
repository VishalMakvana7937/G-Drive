Hello, my name is Vishal, and I’m from surat,gujrat. I completed my 12th grade in 
science in 2021, and I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) 
at Bhagwan Mahavir University. I’m also excited to be working as a full-time 
full-stack developer at Swiftrut Technologies.

In my role at Swiftrut Technologies, I have the opportunity to work on exciting projects
that allow me to apply my skills in full-stack development. I have a strong foundation 
in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and I’m passionate about 
creating innovative web solutions. One project I’m particularly proud of is the Task 
Management System I developed, which involved advanced features like CSV bulk data 
export and import, task filtering, and performance optimization. This project helped 
me improve my problem-solving skills and gain valuable experience in handling complex 
data operations.

Moving forward, my goal is to further develop my skills and contribute to Swiftrut 
Technologies by creating efficient, scalable, and innovative web applications. I aim 
to bring fresh ideas, collaborate with my team, and stay updated with the latest 
technologies. I believe my passion for technology and dedication to excellence will 
help us succeed together.

Thank you for this opportunity, and I’m excited about the journey ahead with 
Swiftrut Technologies.
