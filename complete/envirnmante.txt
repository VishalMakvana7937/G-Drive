Good morning/afternoon everyone

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges we face today. Rising temperatures
are causing extreme weather, from floods to wildfires, disrupting lives across the 
globe. It’s not just an environmental issue but a threat to our health, economies, 
and future. We must act now before the damage becomes irreversible.

Problems (30 seconds): We’re already seeing the impact—frequent wildfires, floods, 
and hurricanes are destroying ecosystems and displacing millions. Agriculture is 
struggling, leading to food shortages and rising prices. Pollution and heatwaves 
are also worsening health problems like respiratory diseases. The longer we wait, 
the more severe these problems will become.

Solutions (1.5 minutes): But there is hope—solutions are within reach. Firstly, we 
need to focus on reducing carbon emissions. Shifting to renewable energy sources 
like solar and wind is a critical step. Countries like Sweden have already started 
transitioning to clean energy, and we need to follow suit globally.

Secondly, we must protect and restore our forests. Trees naturally absorb CO2, and 
reforestation can help combat global warming. In addition, we need to invest in 
green technologies, such as electric vehicles, to cut down on pollution.

Finally, we as individuals can make a difference by reducing waste, using energy 
responsibly, and supporting businesses that prioritize sustainability. Advocacy 
for stronger environmental policies is equally important—holding industries and 
governments accountable is key to ensuring change happens.

Conclusion (30 seconds): In conclusion, climate change is a real threat, but with 
collective action, we can make a difference. The time to act is now—every step we 
take today will create a better future for the generations to come.
